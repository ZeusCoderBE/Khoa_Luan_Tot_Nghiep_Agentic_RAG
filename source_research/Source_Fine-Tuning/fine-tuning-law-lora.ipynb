      "ID: Điều kiện nghỉ hưu trước tuổi đối với lao động nam\n",
      "Predicted Answer: Bảo hiểm xã hội tỉnh Tiền Giang\n",
      "Correct Answers: Bảo hiểm xã hội tỉnh Tiền Giang trả lời vấn đề này như sau:Căn cứ quá trình tham gia BHXH của ông Thọ trên phần mềm Quản lý Thu - Sổ, thẻ (TST);Căn cứ Điều 4 Nghị định số135/2020/NĐ-CPngày 18/11/2020 của Chính phủ quy định về tuổi nghỉ hưu \"Kể từ ngày 1/1/2021 tuổi nghỉ hưu của người lao động trong điều kiện bình thường là đủ 60 tuổi 3 tháng đối với lao động nam và đủ 55 tuổi 4 tháng đối với lao động nữ; sau đó, cứ mỗi năm tăng thêm 3 tháng đối với nam cho đến khi đủ 62 tuổi vào năm 2028 và cứ mỗi năm tăng thêm 4 tháng đối với lao động nữ cho đến khi đủ 60 tuổi vào năm 2035\".Đối chiếu quá trình tham gia BHXH của ông Thọ trên phần mềm, tuổi đời với quy định tại Phụ lục I ban hành kèm theo Nghị định số 135/2020/NĐ-CP, ông Thọ sinh ngày 6/10/1970 và làm việc trong điều kiện lao động bình thường (không thuộc chức danh nghề nặng nhọc độc hại). Như vậy, tính đến tháng 10/2028, ông tham gia BHXH được 35 năm 7 tháng và vừa tròn 58 tuổi nên chưa đủ điều kiện về tuổi đời để hưởng chế độ hưu trí theo quy định (từ tháng 5/2028 trở về sau, lao động nam làm việc trong điều kiện lao động bình thường phải 62 tuổi mới đủ điều kiện hưởng chế độ hưu trí).Trường hợp ông muốn nghỉ hưu trước tuổi (58/62 tuổi) phải thỏa mãn điều kiện bị suy giảm khả năng lao động và được Hội đồng giám định y khoa kết luận suy giảm khả năng lao động từ 61% trở lên thì được hưởng lương hưu với mức thấp hơn (cứ mỗi năm nghỉ hưu trước tuổi quy định thì giảm 2%).Căn cứ Luật BHXH hiện hành và các văn bản hướng dẫn có liên quan, tỷ lệ lương hưu của ông nếu tính tại thời điểm tháng 10/2028 = 67% (đã trừ 8% do nghỉ hưu trước tuổi) nhân với mức bình quân tiền lương tháng đóng BHXH của 5 năm cuối trước khi nghỉ hưu. Đồng thời, ông được cơ quan BHXH cấp thẻ BHYT và hưởng quyền lợi khám, chữa bệnh theo Luật BHYT, với mức 95% chi phí khám bệnh, chữa bệnh phát sinh (chỉ phải chi trả 5%).\n",
